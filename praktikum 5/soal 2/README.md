Praktikum D - Modul 6 JavaScript

Files added:
- `index.html` - Minimal page with heading, input and two buttons.
- `styles/style.css` - Simple styling.
- `scripts/main.js` - DOM manipulation and event handlers.

How to try locally:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a name and click "Greet me" to change the heading.
3. Click "Change heading color" to toggle color.

Notes:
- I implemented a safe `escapeHtml` helper.
- If you want the exact exercise from the PDF implemented differently, paste the exercise text or page number and I'll adapt.
